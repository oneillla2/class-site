  <p>I my lungs long ago in the belly of the beast. I got my gall from the boys back east. I sing sweet songs with the throat that belongs to her. She wears my heart and wears my words. Found my fingers up north in the forest of the fern. I blame
    them words for all I've learned. Well I watched my wits walk west where the money is earned. Just to strut my stuff and wait my turn. Put all the rest in a hollow tree. Then fill it with cement and let me be.
