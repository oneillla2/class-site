    <p>What does home feel like online? Where is it that you can go online that feels contained, personal, and intentional? If we imagine the websites that we visit most often as physical spaces, I think we would find architectural nightmares. Even the most mundane, isolated corners have comment sections or share buttons. We have our public and near private spheres that we inhabit online, but where is it that we can go (or do go) to turn in and turn off for the night? Our browsers are mostly designed as windows into that public space but house some private spaces and elements of personalizationâ€”like the new tab page or our bookmarks catalog.</p>
